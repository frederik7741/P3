## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the power of image processing techniques to assist in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The primary objective is to create a system capable of accurately counting the repetitions of specific exercises performed by stroke patients during their rehabilitation sessions.

### Project Scope

Our project scope includes the implementation of image processing algorithms to automate the counting of exercise repetitions. The system is designed to provide feedback, offer a user-friendly interface, and log data for further analysis.
## Dependencies
Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system before running the Stroke Rehabilitation Exercise Repetition Counter:

### Python and Packages
For using this system there are some Dependencies you need on your pc, all of the packages can be downloaded in your code editor using the pip install (Name) in your terminal.

 **Python (3.7)**
   - The image processing is developed using the programming languages Python, and it is essential to have Python installed on your system. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

 **Numpy (1.19.2)**
  - NumPy is the fundamental package for array computing with Python. Either have an Enviorment with NumPy or download the package from [numpy.org](https://www.numpy.org)

  **OpenCV (4.8.1.78)**
   - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is written in C/C++, for real time computer vision. It takes advantage of multi-core processing and hardware acceleration. Applications of OpenCV includes egomotion estimation, gesture recognition, facial recognition system, and artificial neural networks. Either have an Enviorment with OpenCV or download the package from [opencv.org](https://opencv.org/get-started/)

  **Flask (2.0.3)**
- A simple framework for building complex web applications. Homepage for [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask)
  

  **Flask_CORS (4.0.0)**
- A Flask extension adding a decorator for CORS support. Github page for [Flask_Cors](https://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors
)

### Unity
- Unity is a widely-used cross-platform game development engine that allows developers to create 2D and 3D games with a comprehensive set of tools and a user-friendly interface. It supports multiple platforms, including PC, mobile devices, and consoles. Unity can be downloaded from [unity.com](https://unity.com/download)
